### Project Plan

1. Conduct academic research to understand the communication dynamics inherent in romantic relationships.
2. Engage with GPT Builder to build out the initial shell of the "Romantic Advisor" GPT
3. Upload relevant documents to further train the GPT on appropriate relationship communications strategies
4. Test the GPT's performance through a romantic advisor scenario
5. Fine-tune the GPT by directly tweaking its instructions through the "Configure" tab of GPT Builder
