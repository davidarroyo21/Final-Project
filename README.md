# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Final Project

Leesa Quinlan & David Arroyo

## Project Overview

Our project documents the creation of a GPT that is capable of providing romantic advice. The GPT that we created can address a wide range of relationship issues by asking clear, probing questions and offering tactful advice.

### Background

This project will be based on Leesa's research paper, where she explored how LLMs respond in emotionally charged communication scenarios. We wanted to continue this line of reasoning by creating a GPT that could provide romantic advice using ChatGPT's GPT Builder platform.

### Folder Structure

This document provides the documentation needed to understand the development process for the "Romantic Advisor" GPT, including the test conversations that were conducted, as well as the manual tweaks made to the GPT's instructions. The files in this folder include:

01. **[Planning & Design](01.Planning&Design):** Overview of the project plan and methodology
02. **[Bibtex Bibliography](02.BibexBibliography.ipynb):** List of sources used
03. **[Creation](03.Creation.pdf):** Transcript of the process to create the Romantic Advisor using GPT builder
04. **[Finetuning](04.Finetuning.pdf):** List of iterative updates to the GPT through direct changes to the GPT's instructions
05. **[Testing](05.Testing.pdf):** Transcript of test conversations and updates to the GPT via interactions with GPT builder
06. **[Observations](06.Observations&Summary.md):** Summary and Observations
